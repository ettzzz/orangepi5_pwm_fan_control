# Orangepi 5 PWM FAN control

forked from [https://github.com/Serjdud/orangepizero2_pwm_fan_control](https://github.com/Serjdud/orangepizero2_pwm_fan_control) and re-write some args to fit Orangepi 5.

The clock frequency for Orangepi 5 seems to be slightly different from the original repo. It's modified in `fan_control.py` with comments. Also the pin number of PWM pin is different, here I use `pwm15-m2` in the [user manual](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-pi-5.html). Other stuff is the same as original repo.
